<p>My name is Michael Jeremiah Curry. I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the
University of Maryland, College Park in the Computer Science department, advised by John Dickerson and Tom Goldstein and affiliated with the Center for Machine Learning.
Previously I attended Columbia University, where I received an MS in computer
science, and Amherst College, where I received a BA in computer science.</p>

<p>I am broadly interested in machine learning. Most recently, I'm working on a project applying reinforcement learning to dynamic set packing, which was presented in preliminary form at <a href="rldm.org">RLDM</a> this summer under the title "Reinforcement learning for dynamic set packing" (Curry, McElfresh, You, Moy, Huang, Goldstein, Dickerson).
</p>


<p>I have a <a href="good-software.html">non-exhaustive list</a> of some free software that I like.</a></p>

<p>You should read the book <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00567">Computational Optimal Transport</a> by Gabriel Peyr&eacute; and Marco Cuturi. It's very good.</p>

<p>Our paper "Mix and Match: Markov Chains &amp; Mixing Times for Matching in Rideshare" (Michael Curry, John Dickerson, Karthik Abinav Sankararaman, Aravind Srinivasan, Yuhao Wan, Pan Xu) was recently accepted to WINE 2019. Note that names are in alphabetical order.
